#  Towards Sharing Tools and Artifacts for **Reproducible** Simulation **(v1.5)**: a JuypterLite template for `simpy` models

## 1. Overview

The materials and methods in this repository support work towards developing the S.T.A.R.S healthcare framework version 1.5 (**S**haring **T**ools and **A**rtifacts for **R**eproducible **S**imulations in healthcare).  The code and written materials here are a work in progress to demonstrate the application of S.T.A.R.S' version to sharing a `simpy` discrete-event simuilation model and associated research artifacts. 

The model will run on a users browser without the need to install any components.  This is achieved using Web Assembly technology i.e. [JupterLite](https://github.com/jupyterlite/jupyterlite) and [xeus-python](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-python).  A model notebook is downloaded to the users local machine and all dependencies are pre-installed via conda-forge. The model then lives in the browsers cache. The user can make changes to the model or create new files and these are persisted (until the browser cache is cleared).  

### 1.1. Use case

* A researcher wishes to share a runnable version of a simulation model with their publication (e.g. written in `simpy`).  The code allows others to replicate the simulation results, tables and charts in a paper and allows others to reuse the model.
* The researcher wants the model to be immediately usable. Users should not need to install python, `simpy` or any dependencies.
* The researcher either wants to reduce load on online open science compute infrastructure (e.g. mybinder.org) or does not want to rely on it. 
* Users may want to use a version of their own data due to governance, ethics or other reasons **cannot upload the data to a remote instance of the model.**
* Loading the model is as simple as clicking a URL.

### 1.2. Credits âœ¨

> We would like to thank the [JupterLite](https://github.com/jupyterlite/jupyterlite) and [xeus-python](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-python) developers for making this work possible. This discrete-event simulation focussed repository was based on the learning materials and template provided by [Jupyterlite xeus-python demo](https://github.com/jupyterlite/xeus-python-demo) and [tutorial given at PyData 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXRslU9D3bo) by Jeremy Tuloup.

## 2. The example model included

The `simpy` model is adapted from [Monks and Harper (2023)](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/stars-simpy-example-docs)

Full documentation of this model is available in our [JupyterBook](https://pythonhealthdatascience.github.io/stars-simpy-example-docs)

In summary, we adapt a textbook example from Nelson (2013): a terminating discrete-event simulation model of a U.S based treatment centren summary the model. The example is based on exercise 13 from Nelson (2013) page 170.

## 4. Customise your simulation environment

## ðŸ“¦ How to install extra packages for your DES model.

The repo contains two environment files. To install more dependencies for your DES model and analysis you need to edit the ``environment.yml`` file.

The template ``environment.yml`` is as follows:


```yml
name: xeus-python-kernel
channels:
  - https://repo.mamba.pm/emscripten-forge
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - xeus-python
  - ipycanvas
  - simpy=4.1.1
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
```

**Key points:**

* There are two channels in use. 
  * `encription-forge` contains specific versions of the packages for web assembly These include `numpy` `pandas`, and `matplotlib`. Other popular packages include `scipy`, `scikit-learn` and `pytest`.
  * `conda-forge` for other installs you can use conda-forge.  Only ``no-arch`` packages from ``conda-forge`` can be installed (simpy qualifies)
* Note that `numpy`, `pandas` and `matplotlib` have specific versions available on `enscription-forge`. For this reason we recommend not including the package version number.
* `simpy` is installed from `conda-forge` we were therefore able to freeze the version to 4.1.1 to aid reproducibility.
* At the time of writing the xeus-python kernal will use python 3.11.3

As an example modification assume that you wanted to add two new packages: `plotly` and `scipy`.  The first `plotly` is available ``no-arch`` from conda-forge so it is safe to include and if you wanted to you could try to include a version number. There is a specific version of `scipy` is available on `encription-forge`

Our modified environment looks like:

```yml
name: xeus-python-kernel
channels:
  - https://repo.mamba.pm/emscripten-forge
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - xeus-python
  - ipycanvas
  - simpy=4.1.1
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - plotly
  - scipy
```

If you wanted to use an alternative simulation package to `simpy` this would need to be available on `conda-forge` and be ``no-arch``.  An example package is `salabim`.  A modification of the enviroment is:


```yml
name: xeus-python-kernel
channels:
  - https://repo.mamba.pm/emscripten-forge
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - xeus-python
  - ipycanvas
  - salabim
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - plotly
  - scipy
```
